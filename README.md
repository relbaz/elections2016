2016 elections simulations

A very simple elections simulation: repeat K = 5000 rounds, where for each round iterate on all the states and simulate it going to democrats or republicans according to current probabilities from the new york times (Nov 7 early am).

Sum the number of democrat wins, republican wins, and ties, out of K.
Also print a list of the more common electroal votes.

Interestingly, in this model Trump only gets 3% chance of winning.
